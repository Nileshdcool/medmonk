  "At Medmonk, we take pride in our long history of patient advocacy. From the very beginning, our focus has always been clear: patients are our top priority.",
  "Medmonk's story began in 2009 when co-founder Somaira Punjwani, an HIV specialty pharmacist, developed a unique process to help patients struggling with their copays instead of turning them away. For over three years, she managed this manually, receiving tremendous positive feedback. This innovative approach led to the founding of Medmonk in 2012. As a Silicon Valley-based company incubated by Y Combinator, we have leveraged our innovative roots to build a robust and impactful patient support system.",
  "Our team is composed of dedicated pharmacists, nurses, patient advocates, and reimbursement specialists who bring extensive experience and a shared passion for supporting patients with their life-saving medications. We understand the unique challenges faced by patients with rare diseases and are committed to going the extra mile to assist them. This dedication is reflected in Medmonk's impressive average brand retention of seven years.",
